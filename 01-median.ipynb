    "In the previous notebook, we worked with a general-purpose *mathematical* programming problem, the *knapsack problem*, which seeks to maximise the benefit gained from \"packing\" a set of objects such that all objects fit into the knapsack. We use binary decision variables $x_i$ to represent whether or not an item is taken (with $i=1...n$). Items each have some benefit $b_i$ and size $s_i$; our knapsack has a total size of $c$, past which we cannot pack any more items in. With these symbols, we state the *knapsack problem* as: \n",

    "## The unique challenge of spatial optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, any *spatial* optimisation problem requires us to use a *spatial decision variable* to represent the spatial *locations of* or *relation between* decisions we take. Often, *relation* decisions are either *allocation* or *routing* decisions, which will be explained in detail below. Spatial optimisation can be quite challenging because the number of decisions we have to make about spatial *relations* will balloon rapidly as the problem size gets larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the knapsack problem is an *aspatial* optimisation problem: items are either \"packed\" or they're \"not packed.\" This \"packed\"/\"not packed\" decision variable is similar to a *locational* decision variable. When we are are trying to determine which site is the best to *locate* a facility, we use one binary *locational decision variable* for each item being located: is site A chosen for a facility or not? Note that this means there is no information about the *relation* of items in the knapsack or locations being sited to one another. We don't use a decision variable that indicates we would prefer to pack pencils *more than* packing pens, or locate at site A *instead of* site B, for example. This preference is implicit in the final set of decisions: do we pack pens *and* pencils, or just pack *pencils*? \n",
    "\n",
    "Many *other* kinds of spatial optimisation problems do require *relational decision variables* that represent decisions we make that relate two things. A very common example of a relational decision variable is an *allocation* variable that tracks whether we *allocate* an object to a given class. For example, an \"allocation\" decision in a knapsack example might be needed if you were trying to figure out whether to take chewing gum *in your backpack* or *in your pocket*. The \"location-style\" decision variable is \"do I pack chewing gum?\", and the \"allocation-style\" decision is that \"do I pack the chewing gum in my pocket or in my backpack?\" In fact, many spatial optimisation problems are *location-allocation* problems like this, where locational decisions about \"do we locate a facility at site A?\" are paired with *allocation* decisions: does the facility at site A serve client 1? Often, we intend to *allocate* some larger number of things (clients, items to take to school) to a smaller number of things (facilities, backpack or pocket). This *location-allocation* framework covers many of the most important problems in spatial optimisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of *spatial* optimisation problems involves *routing* decisions. These are sometimes relatively easy, like solving for the [*shortest path*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) from one location to another. But, other kinds of problems, like trying to find an optimal [*delivery route*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), are quite difficult. In both of these problems, the *spatial decision variable* involves a choice about whether or not a *link* between two *waypoints* is selected or not. Similar to an *allocation* variable, the decision variable about the *route* is a binary variable for *each pair of waypoints*: do we go from site A to site B? \n",
    "\n",
    "While this sounds simple, the number of decisions being made grows quickly for *allocation* and *routing* problems. Generally, problems that involve only *location* decisions are the smallest and easier to solve, followed by those that involve *allocation*, and finally those that involve *routing*. And, *location* problems are already among the class of hardest computational problems to solve to optimality, so \"easier\" does not mean \"easy\"! Problems are made more complex when decisions are *contingent upon* other decisions, hence a *location-allocation* problem will be harder to solve generally than an *allocation* problem where the location decisions are already made. Problems that entail all three (location-allocation-routing) are quite difficult to solve indeed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us think about a concrete example to make this clearer. Imagine we have 8 delivery trucks split across 4 possible depot sites. But, we only have the funding to operate *two* depots. Each truck should start and end its delivery route in its depot. Over the course of the day, we need to deliver to 5,000 housing units in total. In this case, we can illustrate the three typical kinds of *spatial* decision variables as the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *locating depots*: do we locate a depot at site $i$? This is often just a binary decision variable, $x_i$, for each possible depot site. Thus, it represents $4$ decision variables.\n",
    "2. *allocating trucks to depots*: does truck $j$ get allocated to depot $i$? This is a small matrix of decision variables, $\\mathbf{Y}$, with one $z_{ij}$ for each $i,j$ pair representing whether truck $j$ will be allocated to depot $i$. It represents $8 * 4$ decision variables. \n",
    "3. *allocating houses to trucks*: does house $k$ get allocated to truck $j$? This is a matrix of decision variables $\\mathbf{Z}$, with one $Z_{jk}$ for each $j,k$ pair representing whether truck $j$ will be allocated to deliver to house $k$. It represents $8 * 5,000$ decision variables overall. \n",
    "4. *routing trucks*: what route does truck $j$ take to serve its allocated houses $k$? Classically, this is represented by a $k \\times k$ matrix for *each* $j$, $\\mathbf{R}_j$, that records whether the link between $k_1$ and $k_2$ is selected for the route. This results in $k^2$ decision variables *per truck*, which (optimistically, when all routes have the same size) is just over $3,000,000$ decision variables for all trucks! \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, you can see how a simple problem like parcel delivery gets very large, very quickly. We will cover decisions 1 and 3 to discuss an introductory spatial optimisation problem. \n",
    "\n",
    " ## Introducing classical location-allocation: the P-Median problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The $p$-Median problem is the challenge of locating some set number ($p$) of \"medians\" so that they minimise the distance to a set of sites we're trying to service. For our purposes, we will also refer to the medians as \"facilities\" and the sites we're trying to service as \"clients,\" to match the `spopt` package's terms. Sometimes, facilities can be located anywhere (in the \"continuous P-Median\" model). In our case, we will focus on cases where medians can only occupy fixed locations, the \"discrete P-Median\" model, which is more common in planning and site selection tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have a collection of decisions to make. First, we make a locational decision: do we open a facility at site $j$? If we have $m$ possible sites for facilities, this can be represented with $m$ decision variables ($y_j$). Then, we need to *allocate* clients to open facilities. If we have $n$ clients, this requires us to build a \"client-to-facility\" matrix ($\\mathbf{Z}$)of shape $n \\times m$ to record the allocation decisions for each client to each facility, $z_{ij}$. Note that this allocation decision of site $i$ to facility $j$ is *contingent upon* the location decision at $j$: we cannot assign any clients to a \"closed\" facility ($y_j = 0$)! \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to model how \"good\" our problem solution is. Generally in median problems, we define the \"cost\" of an allocation to represent the effort required to satisfy the allocation: we consider the *distance* between each client and facility pair and *how much* has to be carried over that distance. This generally represents the \"work\" you do for that allocation decision, and is flexible enough to accommodate nonlinear functions of distance (e.g. increasing costs to travel with a squared distance or decreasing costs to travel with a logarithmic distance). For the clasical $p$-Median problem, we represent our \"work\" as the distance ($d_{ij}$) between facilities and their allocated clients *times* the amount of stuff we're carrying from facilty to client ($w_i$). But, we will *only* carry something from facility $j$ to client $i$ *if* we make an allocation decision $z_{ij}$. Thus, for all client-facility pairs, we want to minimise the sum of the weighted distances between clients and assigned facilities: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{11}z_{11}w_{1} + d_{12}z_{12}w_{1} + ... + d_{1m}z_{1m}w_{1} + d_{21}z_{21}w_2 + d_{22}z_{22}w_2 + ... + d_{nm}z_{nm}w_{n} = \\sum_i^n\\sum_j^m d_{ij}z_{ij}w_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when client $i$ is assigned to facility $j$ ($z_{ij}=1$), we get $d_{ij}*1*w_i=d_{ij}w_i$, distance times load size. But, when client $i$ is *not* assigned to facility $j$, $z_{ij} = 0$, so $d_{ij}*0*w_i=0$. This is how we represent the sum of distances between clients and their allocated facility, the *objective* of the p-median model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the model, we need to make sure that (1) only $p$ facilities are located and (2) every client is allocated to one open facility. For (1), we can use something like our size constraint from the knapsack problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{j}^{m} y_{j} = p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This *constraint* ensures that exactly $p$ facilities are located, since the sum of $y_i$ represents the number of facilities opened. For (2), we have to make sure that every client is assigned to one (and only one) facility. So, we have to write a constraint for *each client* to ensure it gets assigned to one facility. \n",
    "$$ \\sum_{j}^{m} z_{ij} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we will have $n$ constraints that ensure that clients are assigned to exactly one open facility. But, note that this constraint *does not* ensure that we allocate client $i$ to an _open_ facility $j$: $z_{ij}$ could be 1 while $y_j$ could be zero! Thus, we need an *allocation* constraint linking $z$ and $y$, to ensure that no client can be assigned to a closed facility. This requires a constraint on *each decision variable* $z_{ij}$ that ensures $z_{ij}$ can only be $1$ if $y_j$ is one: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_{ij} \\leq y_j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the siutation we describe above where a client is assigned to a closed facility (in math, $z_{ij} = 1$ when $y_{j} = 0$) can never happen *so long as* this constraint is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these comprise the P-Median problem: "

    "\n",
    "Also a few caveats are in order. First, when the weight of each demand is constant, we can ignore $w_i$ in our formulation and solve a simpler *unweighted $p$-Median model*. However, this is rarely the case, so we'll consider the typical *weighted $p$-Median model*. Also, note that if we allocate client $i$ to facility $j$, we're committing to serving *all of* the demand client $i$ has using facility $j$; no other facility is allowed to help. If we relax this and allow for multiple facilities to help out with serving demand $i$, this is known as a *fractional allocation* $p$-Median model. This is encountered occasionally, but can be challenging to explain and investigate the results, so we will keep to the total allocation version. "

    "$p$-Median problems are a kind of *spatial optimisation* problem that occurs when trying to locate $p$ facilities and allocate $n$ clients points to these facilities. It requires both *location* decisions (where to place facilities) and *allocation* decisions (what client is served by what facility). As such, is it considered a fundamental *location-allocation* problem, and has structures common to many different kinds of spatial optimisation problems, such as the transportation problem or the warehouse location problem. Many different customisations can be implemented *on top* of the $p$-Median problem, such as the *unweighted*, *continuous*, *capacitated*, or *fractional allocation* problems. Regardless, the $p$-Median problem can be stated and solved easily in Python using the `spopt` library, which wraps the large amount of constraint and variable declarations required to build the $p$-Median model in the underlying `pulp` package. It supports many variants of the $p$-Median problem, including cases where the client sites are not the same as the facility sites and the use of travel time/routing distances.  "
